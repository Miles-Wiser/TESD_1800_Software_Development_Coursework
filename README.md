# TESD_1800_Software_Development_Coursework

## Purpose
This repository holds all coursework for TESD 1800 Software Development at Southwest Technical College. Each chapter folder contains an assignment folder for all assignments. The "Pace_Calculator" folder is the finally and most recent folder. It is the final project and culmination of all knowledge gained in this course.<br><br>
"2048_Game" is from the previous course. It is the only assignment that was submitted to GitHub at the time. It has no home and thus only really fits here as the prerequiste coursework for TESD 1800.
